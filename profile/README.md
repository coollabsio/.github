# Our Open Source Philosophy.

  Software should be free and accessible to everyone.

  We believe that great software should be available to everyone, regardless of their budget. That's why all of our projects are completely free and open source, with no features locked behind paywalls.

  This isn't just a business decision - it's a core belief. We've seen too many promising open-source projects slowly close their doors, adding "enterprise" features and artificial limitations. We chose a different path.

  ## What This Means.

  Our commitments to the community.

  - **Free and Open Source.** Every project we build is 100% open source. You can view the code, modify it, learn from it, and use it however you want.

  - **No Features Behind Paywalls.** Every feature we develop goes into the open-source version. There's no "enterprise edition" with the good stuff locked away. What you see is what you get - everything.

  - **Apache License.** We use the Apache 2.0 license, which gives you the freedom to use our software for any purpose. However, we kindly ask that you don't commercially redistribute our work as your own product. The license allows it, but we'd appreciate if you didn't.

  - **Forever Free.** This isn't a temporary strategy or a growth hack. This is how we believe software should be made. These principles will never change.

  ## How We Sustain Development.

  Because we still need to pay the bills.

  Making software free doesn't mean development is free. We sustain our work through two main channels:

  **Community Donations.** If you find our projects valuable, you can support us through GitHub Sponsors or Open Collective. Every contribution helps us dedicate more time to development and support.

  **Hosted Services.** For those who prefer not to self-host, we offer managed cloud versions of our software. You get the same features, we handle the infrastructure, and the revenue helps fund continued development.

  This model lets us focus on building great software for real users, not on pleasing investors or hitting arbitrary growth metrics.

  ## Where We Are Today.

  Transparency in numbers.

  | Metric | Value |
  |--------|-------|
  | Hosted Services MRR | ~$15K+ |
  | Cloud Users | 2,500+ |
  | GitHub Sponsors / month | ~$4,500 |
  | Open Collective / month | ~$1,200 |

  This revenue allows us to work on these projects full-time, hire help, and keep improving the software for everyone.

  This philosophy guides everything we do at [coolLabs](https://coollabs.io). Whether it's Coolify or any other project we build, the principles remain the same: free, open, and built for the community.

  Thank you to everyone who supports this vision - through donations, by using our hosted services, or simply by using and sharing our software. You make this possible.
